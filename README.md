# Twitter Data Analysis Project

 # Overview

This project is a Python-based analysis of tweets from Rutgers and former President Donald Trump, aimed at uncovering trends in sentiment, engagement, and tweet patterns. By utilizing advanced data science techniques, the project provides insights into tweet content, sentiment distribution, and engagement metrics, leveraging a range of Python libraries for analysis and visualization.

# Key Features

Sentiment Analysis: Evaluates the positive or negative sentiment of tweets using the VADER lexicon.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Identifies patterns in tweet text by reducing dimensionality.

Text Embeddings: Uses SentenceTransformers to compute dense vector representations of tweets.

Engagement Analysis: Explores trends in retweets, favorites, and device usage.

Visualization: Includes insightful visualizations like heatmaps, bar plots, and distribution plots.

# Python Libraries Used

pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

NLTK: Natural language processing for tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.

Scikit-learn: PCA analysis.

SentenceTransformers: Text embeddings and similarity calculations.
